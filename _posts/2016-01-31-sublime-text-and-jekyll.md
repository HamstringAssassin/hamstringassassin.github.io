Sublime has worked its way into the daily lives of most developers. Part of that is due to how easy it is to extend and customise as well as how small a footprint it has on a computer. Its fast, and lean and does what you want it to do. Using Package Control makes it even easier. 

A useful plugin to help with Jekyll posts is [jekyll] [jekyllPluginUrl]. (duh!)

Installing it is easy from package control and once installed makes writing blog posts that bit easier. 

Simply type `cmd + k + p` to create a new post.

More info on how to use the plugin can be found [here] [jekyllPluginUrl].
