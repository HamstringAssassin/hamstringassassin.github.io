blurb: <p><strong>Alan specializes in making iOS Apps.</strong> He loves to code in both Objective-C and Swift. He also dables in web design and likes to think that he has a good eye for aesthetics.</p><p>When hes not building beautiful, powerful, clean, award-winning apps, he can be found near large bodies of water. He loves surfing and has been known to drive for 8 hours to the Atlantic ocean to surf some of the most beautiful locations Ireland has to offer. He's also a competitive swimmer. So asking about water sports is a way to never shut him up. :) </p><p>For more on Al, you can catch him up <a href="https://twitter.com/HammyAssassin">here</a>...</p>
